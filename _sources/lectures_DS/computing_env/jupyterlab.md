# Intro to JupyterLab

## JupyterLab
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) will be our primary method for
interacting with the computer. JupyterLab contains a complete environment for
interactive scientific computing which runs in your web browser. Jupyter is an
open source python project that was started by scientists like yourselves who
wanted a more effective way to interact with their computers.

JupyterLab has excellent documentation. Rather than repeat that documentation
here, we point you to their docs. The following pages are particularly relevant:

- [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
- [Working with Files](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html)
- [The Text Editor](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_editor.html)
- [Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)
- [Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html)
- [Managing Kernels and Terminals](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/running.html)

You will gain experience and familiarity with JupyterLab over the course of the
semester as we use it in our weekly lectures and assignments.

## Other development environments
There are other ways to interact with the computer using python as well. A summary of these can be found [here](https://github.com/yutianwuldeo/GR6901/blob/main/week2_how_to_run_python.md).

## Markdown

Throughout the course, we will write rich text documents using Markdown.
Here are some useful references on Markdown syntax.

## Our Course JupyterHub

[JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is multi-user Jupyter environment designed for companies, classrooms and research labs.
This course will use a cloud-based JupyterHub environment supported by the [NSF LEAP STC](https://leap.columbia.edu/) and
managed by [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/infrastructure/):
